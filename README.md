# Avalon

Why Avalon...

> In Arthurian legend, the Isle of Avalon bridged worlds, guiding souls from struggle to liberation.
>
> Today, we're trapped in digital realms that limit our freedom and stifle our free will. Controlled access to information, AI, communication, and money has become our modern cage.
> 
> Avalon recreates that mythical bridge, allowing anyone with minimal technology - just simple text-based interaction - to bypass restrictions and access an open-source world of information, tools, communication, and finance.

## The Problem

A majority of internet infrastructure in the world today is built around a handful of centralised platforms, access points and hardware vendors. 

Open platforms have begun to proliferate with Nostr, Bitcoin, Internet publishing and open source AI tools making great gains. 

However they simply arent available to all given an expectation of all users having a reasonable smartphones, low latency internet access, money for data packages or exclusive ownership of the phone. 

Furthermore when we see crackdowns and chokepoints targeting these freedom technologies we see the central infrastructure points (hosting, DNS, app stores, ip filtering) begin to be targetted reducing access and requiring users to learn more complex technical work arounds.

If there is a choke point, it appears it will be choked.

Some examples: 

* Often internet access is available but priced out for many and so phones become wifi terminals or rely on free access to walled gardens like WhatsApp and Facebook.
* Under authoritarian regimes stop and search activities can lead to firther surveillance, imprisonment or further consequences where "disallowed apps" are doscovered on the phone. 
* In many countries excessive IP filtering, poor networks and surveillance can lead to poor experiences in apps that otherwise work fine in open internet environments.
* Many users globally still rely on feature phones (often with some limited app access e.g WhatsApp given subsidised network access) that provide no cosistent data storage or ability to install apps or run programs.
* Banning of apps in app stores as they begin to become popular, to avoid people flocking to freedom technologies such as bitcoin wallets and nostr clients as they grow in popularity. 

## Proposed Solution

Where there are choke points they will be choked. The purpose of Avalon is to drop the barrier to entry for freedom technologies extremely low and then spread access ubiquotiously, using alternative networks and tools. We will meet users where they already are and provide a simple route in to a larger world of free information and services. 

Every chat app, every text box on the internet shouhld become a potential bridge to freedom providing access to freedom money, freedom social and freedom information.

### How

Avalon consists of three core components:

1. Gateways
2. Services
3. Users

For example in many countriues in Africa and Latin America the Meta Free Basics programm will allow people free to WhatsApp but traps them into this walled garden. However, this free message exchange can become our Trojan Horse allowing an Avalon gateway to smnuggle in free access to information from across the internet, Nostr communicaitons and access to bitcoin. 

It is not the purpose of this project to provide a value judgement on how people would use free access to information, simply to drop the barrier to access to it and assume that people will continue to flourish in a free world. 

## Alternative Considerations

### I have nostr on my phone do I need this? 
 
### Can't people just use VPNs to get around censorship? 



### Expansion
